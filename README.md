# FASTEN Maven plugin

Integrate the power of the [FASTEN project](https://fasten-project.eu) in a Maven build.

It can be used to analyze and report risks (security, license, etc.) found in the dependencies of a module at build time.

The plugin is not yet available on Maven Central, you will need to [configure the GitHub Packages registry access in Maven](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry#authenticating-with-a-personal-access-token).

See https://github.com/fasten-project/fasten-maven-plugin/wiki for more details on how to use it.
